        <p>KV Woods was purchased in &lt;year&gt;. Growing up, we were privileged enough to spend some time on a family friend's working farm for Easter. We followed a trail of blue footprints that to us as kids meant we were chasing the real Easter Bunny! Across gigantic caverns that are actually little streams, climbing mountains which were actually bails of hay. Tending to the newly born lambs, feeding them, and watching over them as the new herd is welcomed into this world. That day once a year was enough to inspire the continued investment in creating great memories for generations to come.</p>
        <p>Let this place forever be...</p>

            <li>A place to create memories</li>
            <li>A place to conserve and observe nature</li>
        </ul>
